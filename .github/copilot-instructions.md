# About

This is a DesignCTER Flutter Application to generate a CT protocol template in emergency department. 

It is a migration app from another DesignCTER app I made using `flet` Python package. The design should be mostly similar with some enhancement. However, UI change can happens. 

# What's Changed

## ID Mapping

Here are the changed ID mapping for better consistency (`old` -> `new`):


`ct_wa` -> `ct_whole_abd`

`cta_wa` -> `cta_whole_abd`

`ct_upperabd` -> `ct_upper_abd`

`ct_lowerabd` -> `ct_lower_abd`

`ct_chest_wa` -> `ct_chest_whole_abd`
